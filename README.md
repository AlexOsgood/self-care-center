# Self-Care Center

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)

Turing School Of Software And Design - Mod1.2 solo project

This was a solo project to build an app from scratch that was a randomizer of mantras and affirmations. The user can click 3 buttons in order to go about picking the random quotes. This page was compared as best as possible to the original with full functionality added. The add on feature that I completed with it was a delete button feature that would allow users to delete unwanted slogans and it would remove them from the list.

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)
