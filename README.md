# Self Care Center
## Overview
How can I care for myself? One way is with affirmations and mantras!
Affirmations are thoughts of positive self-empowerment, meant to assert your self-worth.
Mantras are repetive phrases that are repeated again and again during mindfulness practices. Your challenge is to build an app that helps users remind themselves of their inherent value!

The spec for this project can be found [here](https://frontend.turing.io/projects/module-1/self-care-center.html).

## Learning Goals

- Gain experience building an application that utilizes HTML, CSS and JavaScript
- Write HTML and CSS to match a provided comp
- Understand how to listen to and respond to user events
- Individualize your programming skill s

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)

This was a solo project to build an app from scratch that was a randomizer of mantras and affirmations. The user can click 3 buttons in order to go about picking the random quotes. This page was compared as best as possible to the original with full functionality added. The add on feature that I completed with it was a delete button feature that would allow users to delete unwanted slogans and it would remove them from the list.

### Installation Instructions:
